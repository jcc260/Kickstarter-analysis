# VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, to add even more analytical power to Excel. With this tool we were able to assist Steve with performing stock analysis on which stocks his parents should invest in. VBA is a programming language that interacts with excel so we were able to design a code to analyze the data that was given to us in a more efficient manner. We were then able to refactor that code the second time around so it would decrease the process time and increase effiency.

### Results

The data that is was given included two tables with stock information on twelve different stocks. The stock information contained the ticker name and ticker value which included the date of the opening price, closing price, adjusted closing price, the highest price, lowest price, and the volume of the stock. This was for the years 2017 and 2018. The goal was to first retrieve the total daily volume, and the return for all of 2018 in the worksheet "DQ Analysis". Then we were able to further break down the data using code in the worksheet "All Stock Analysis" and find the total daily volume and return for all 12 stocks for the year 2017 and 2018. I used to temple code provided for me to create the input box, chart headers, ticker array and activate the worksheet so that the code can run the data appropriately. Below is the refracted code that I wrote.

When I completed the refractored code and input the years 2017 and 2018, it took about .07 seconds to run. This was an improvement from the original code that was used for 2017 and 2018 which took .3 seconds to run. A challenge that I faced was debugging errors. I had to review code, make sure that all values were stated and that every string was spelled right. A common mistake I would make is misspelling "tickers" by putting "ticker". It is very important to checks spelling. Remember, the computer is never wrong.

### Summary

The general advantages of of refactoring code is makes code easier to read, fast programming and great for debugging. One major disadvantage is, in a business sense, you might have enough budget time to refactor larger codes to be adaptive.
The refactored code makes are code concise, cleaner and more organized. One advantage is with a more concise and efficient code, the software is improved and faster. It was able to reduce the process time to .07 seconds wihich is an improvment from the orginal .3 second run time (Refer to pictures below). Another advantage is it becoomes easier to read because it is more orangized. Anyone can pick right up from where I left off and make changes accordingly. One major disadvantage is we do not know if this code will work well with a larger data set with a lot more stocks listed. The data set that we used is relatively small.
