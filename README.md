# VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to use Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA, to add even more analytical power to Excel. With this tool we were able to assist Steve with performing stock analysis on which stocks his parents should invest in. VBA is a programming language that interacts with excel so we were able to design a code to analyze the data that was given to us in a more efficient manner. We were then able to refactor that code the second time around so it would decrease the process time and increase effiency.

### Results

The data that is was given included two tables with stock information on twelve different stocks. The stock information contained the ticker name and ticker value which included the date of the opening price, closing price, adjusted closing price, the highest price, lowest price, and the volume of the stock. This was for the years 2017 and 2018. The goal was to first retrieve the total daily volume, and the return for all of 2018 in the worksheet "DQ Analysis". Then we were able to further break down the data using code in the worksheet "All Stock Analysis" and find the total daily volume and return for all 12 stocks for the year 2017 and 2018.
